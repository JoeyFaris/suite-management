Flatiron Phase 5 / Capstone Project

By Joey Faris

For my final project, I'd like to incorporate everything I've learned over the past few months along with what I know from the industry I'm transferring from. During my time in real estate, I've noticed a large issue that tenants have with their landlord is the inconsistent communication that takes place and makes operations more difficult than they need to be. Let's say, a company owns and operate a 30 story office building with a 150 units and 150 tenants within the building. Every week, their can be an overwhelming amount of requests and/or inquiries to the landlord. This application would give each of your tenants a single place to get a general overview about building information (See weekly calendar for building events, review lease agreements and addendums, make maintenence requests, reserve amenities, etc...). The platform would be mutually beneficial as this would provide smoother functionality for landlord-tenant communcation.

User Stories

As a user, I can:

Land on the login page to log in with your company email and password. Navigate to the home page, where they can view a calendar with information on building events and updates Navigate to a payments and balances page, where they can pay rent, and see a breakdown of their balances (Base rent, parking, utilities etc...). Navigate to a leases page, where they can view their lease, check suite information, and provide a notice to vacate. Navigate to a maintenance request page, where they can fill out a form for the service that they need completed. Navigate to a general inquiry request page, where they can check landlord office location/hours and submit a general form to the landlord.

Feature Stories:

Login/Signup This will be the landing page. A user can not have access to the site unless they are a verified employee with a corporate email. If the user doesn't have an account, they can be directed to a sign up page, where they will need to provide full name, suite number, email and password. Once signed in, user will be taken to the home page where they can view the calendar.

Session feature Once the user is signed in and taken to the home page, they will see a greeting with the days date, what company they are with, and the calendar set to the right date with evernts based on that date shown on the page. User can click on the day on the calendar, and will a form will come down with a breakdown of building events for that day

Creating a request As a user, I can go to the maintenance tab, and submit the form that will be POST'd on the backend. Users can also submit a form under 'Notice to Vacate' that will also be POST'd on the backend.

Once completed, this should provide a well structured base for a landlord-tenant communication platform. It will cover all of the most basic topics that are needed to keep a healthy relationship with companies and their buildings.

Stetch Goals

Once the basic structure is completed, here are some goals that I may work on:

If the user is not signed in, they will be taken to a completely seperate home page, where they can view an overview of the application, with seperate tabs, such as:

"Our software" - with a description of the software "Fearutes" - with a breakdown of different features that are benficial to both landlord and tenant "Pricing" - tab for landlords to view if they want a breakdown of pricing for the software "Patners" - with a list of corporations/ addresses that use the application.
